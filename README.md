# KhanAcademyDots

A browser extension for translators of Khan Academy articles and exercises. It auto-translates certain math notations (such as decimal points to decimal commas) based on your locale via an extra button in the Crowdin window. 

**IMPORTANT**: You have to set your locale in the plugin options! 

In FIREFOX:
1. Open "about:addons" (Ctrl+Shift+A)
2. Find Khan Academy Dots plugin and click on "Preferences"
3. Choose your language at the bottom and click Save. If your language is missing, don't hesitate to contant me!

In Chrome:

1. Open chrome://extensions 
2. Find Khan Academy Dots plugin and click on "Details"
3. Scroll down a little bit until you see Extension Options. When you click on it, it should pop-up a language dropdown menu.

After installation, you'll see a new button next to the "copy source button" in Crowdin window. The icon is the same with an added comma inside.

Technical note: The translation is powered by [Translation Assistant](https://github.com/khan/translation-assistant) and is thus compatible with Smart Translations inside the [Translation Editor available at https://khanacademy.org/translations](https://khanacademy.org/translations).
